# Salah Times
Salah is a responsive, mobile-friendly, single page application written in React (v16.8) that displays the five daily prayer timings based on a users location. Users may either acccept a geolocation request, or manually enter their location (city or address).

**Note:** Prayer times are retrived using the [Prayer Times API](https://prayertimes.date/api/docs/today#). Further configuration can be made depending on beliefs/location.
